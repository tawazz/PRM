            <h2>Church History</h2>
            <p>Pentacostal Revival Ministries was born on Easter Monday, 5th of April 2010 after a year of intensive and rotational home and mountain prayer meetings.</p>
            <p>The following were the members of the prayer group through which PRM was born:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Shana Family</li>
            <li>Ziyabangwa Family (Sithole)</li>
            <li>Dzvuke Family</li>
            <li>Brother Cedric Ngadze</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>The PRM family was founded on strong fellowship, unity,love,prayer and guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>All group members had a common desire to see vibrant church that brings good news to nations with demonstration of God's power. Occasionally, the group would meet for&nbsp;prayers on the mountain (Mt Barker) where many testimonies arose after experiencing memomarable encounters with God. During one of the prayer meetings on Mt Barker torwards the end of 2009, God spoke to Apostle Dorothy Ziyabangwa that He had given us the City as with the City Jericho. On 30 March 2010, whilst on a Tuesday evening prayers at &nbsp;Mr and Mrs Shana's residence in Kardinya, Perth, Western Australia, God spoke through Apostle Dorothy again that a new child, without a father was being born in Perth. The birth was confirmed on Easter Monday 5th April 2010 when God spoke again through Apostle Dorothy that the child was born then with a promise of great work, testimonies and that the work would be easy because God would be with us in His palm.</p>

            <p>The first Sunday service was held at Mr and Mrs Dzuke residence in Munster Western Australia on 11 April 2010. The following week we moved out of the house to a hall at ECU in Mount Lawely, Perth ,Western Australia. It was during this service on the 16th April 2010 that God re-affirmed His word through Apostole Dorothy again and said,"You did not choose Me but I had choosen you hence i wont leave you. Do not be afraid for MY Presence is with you, I am ready to do work through you. Do not be afriad, I wont leave you"</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>PRM was born with great focus on the following main scriptures; Mark 16:15-18,</p>
            <p>Mathew 28:19 and Luke 4:18. At PRM we embrace the workings of the five- fold ministry and believe in the power of the Holy Trinity: The Father, The Son &amp; the Holy Ghost.</p>
